You need the OCaml header files. On Debian/Ubuntu, these seem to get set up
correctly on install. Homebrew on OS X required a symlink, e.g.

  $ cd /usr/local/include
  $ ln -s ../Cellar/objective-caml/4.00.0/lib/ocaml/caml .

These header files are used when we create OCaml bindings to primitives
written in C, e.g. for the sendmsg and recvmsg system calls which are
necessary for sending file descriptors between processes.
