You need the OCaml lib header files. On Debian/Ubuntu, these seem to get
set up correctly on install. In Homebrew on OS X, I had to add a symlink,
something like:
  $ cd /usr/local/include
  $ ln -s ../Cellar/objective-caml/4.00.0/lib/ocaml/caml .

These header files are used to create OCaml bindings to the sendmsg and
recvmsg system calls which are necessary for sending file descriptors
between processes.
