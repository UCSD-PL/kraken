Reflex Browser: A Secure Web Browser with A Kernel Verified in Reflex.

Build a verified replacement kernel for Google Chromium to ensure that
it is completely impervious to certain classes of attack.


== Instruction ==

Enter "./run.sh" to execute Reflex Browser. You can type one of the
function keys in the address bar window (a black terminal screen) to
start web browsing :

F12 : Open a new tab 

F1~10 : Focus the tab identified by a function key, and tabs are
assigned a function key in the order they are created by the user.

Reflex Browser is built as a proof of concept; it works on many web
sites but it lacks many functionalities that a normal browser has. For
example, Reflex Browser can open google.com or wikipedia.org, but it
cannot download a file or currently you cannot type a random URL to
open in an opened tab.

== Scenario of Usage ==

./run.sh (enter)

Push F12 in the address bar and type "google.com"

Wait until the new tab is fully loaded

Type some search keywords in the search bar.

Push F12 to open a new tab on "wikipedia.org"
