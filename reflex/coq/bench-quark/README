Reflex Browser: A Secure Web Browser with A Kernel Verified in Reflex.

Build a verified replacement kernel for Google Chromium to ensure that
it is completely impervious to certain classes of attack.

== Directory Explanation ==

./run.sh : shell script to run Reflex Browser.

./Kernel.v : Reflex Browser implementation written in Reflex.

./ml/kernel : compiled executable Reflex Browser which manages other
browser components at the center to guarantee security.

./test/quark/tab/* : HTML Renderer implementation written in
Python (tab component)

./test/quark/input/* : address bar component to take care of keyboard
typing and mouse clicks.

./test/quark/output/* : screen component to actually show the
renderered webpage sent from tab components

./test/quark/cookie/* : cookie component to store and retrieve cookies
for tabs.

== Usage Instruction ==

Enter "./run.sh" to execute Reflex Browser. You can type one of the
function keys in the address bar window (a black terminal screen) to
start web browsing :

F12 : Open a new tab 

F1~10 : Focus the tab identified by a function key, and tabs are
assigned a function key in the order they are created by the user.

Reflex Browser is built as a proof of concept; it works on many web
sites but it lacks many functionalities that a normal browser has. For
example, Reflex Browser can open google.com or wikipedia.org, but it
cannot download a file or currently you cannot type a random URL to
open in an opened tab.

== Scenario of Usage ==

./run.sh (enter)

Push F12 in the address bar and type "google.com"

Wait until the new tab is fully loaded

Type some search keywords in the search bar.

Push F12 to open a new tab on "wikipedia.org"
