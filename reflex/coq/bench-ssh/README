Reflex SSH: A Secure SSH Server Verified in Reflex.

We built a verified replacement SSH server based on OpenSSH. It is
completely impervious to certain classes of attack.

== Directory Explanation ==

./Kernel.v : Reflex SSH implementation written in Reflex

./ml/kernel :compiled executable Reflex SSH comand spawned by inetd
when a client is connected to port 21.

./test/ssh : components spawend/managed by Reflex SSH to support key
exchange and create pseudo terminals for authenticated users. These
components are created based on OpenSSH.


== Usage Instruction ==

If you didn't change the current setting of this virtual machine
you're using, Reflex SSH is running on this machine. Except that
connection teardown is not implemented in Reflex SSH, you can use it
like a normal SSH server using a regular ssh client as follows : 

1. open a new terminal emulator (since you cannot disconnect once your
ssh client is connected).

2. ssh ucsd@localhost (nter)

3. type password "quark"

4. please type the enter key once

5. the ssh connection was served by Reflex SSH and you can use ssh
like a normal SSH server.

The implementation of the components used by the Reflex SSH server is
not complete:
