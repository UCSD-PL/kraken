Description: This simple extension provides two functions to pass and receive file
        descriptors across UNIX domain sockets, using the BSD-4.3+ sendmsg() and
        recvmsg() interfaces.
        
        Direct bindings to sendmsg and recvmsg are not provided, as the API does
        not map nicely into Python.
        
        Please note that this only supports BSD-4.3+ style file descriptor
        passing, and was only tested on Linux. Patches are welcomed!
