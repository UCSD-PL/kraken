* WARNING

For security, you should only run this experimental ssh server in an
isolate environment like a virtual machine!

* INSTALLATION

As root, do the following from within ./openssh-6.1p1/ :

0. Create a dummy user USER. The unprivileged ssh slave will run as USER.

1. Create a RSA key file by `ssh-keygen -t rsa` named KEYFILE. Ensure
KEYFILE is only readable by root by `chmod 400 KEYFILE`, otherwise sshd
will refuse to work.

2. Copy sshd_config.default to /usr/local/etc/sshd_config.  This way our
modified sshd will find our configuration in place of the normal system
default.

3. Edit sshd_mon.h and set the macros appropriately, refering to the USER
account created for Step 0. To get the UID of USER, run `id -u USER`.

4. Build our modified version of openssh by running `./configure` and
`make`. DO NOT RUN `make install`; it may overwrite pre-installed ssh
binaries.

5. Check that inetd is working properly. For now, our priv-sepped ssh only
runs under indetd.

6. Add the following line to /etc/inetd.conf

ssh     stream  tcp     nowait  root    $DIR/sshd_mon       sshd_mon

You have to substitute $DIR with the directory where the compiled
sshd_mon file is located.

7. Restart the inet daemon & enjoy!
