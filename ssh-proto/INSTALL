*You might want to run this experimental ssh server in an isolated
environment like VM to avoid possibly detrimental effects!!

0. Create a dummy user under which the unprivileged ssh slave is going
to run.

1. Create a RSA key file by `ssh-keygen -t rsa`. Make the key file
name as you want, but make it sure that the file is only readable by
the root by chmod 400 $rsafile. Otherwise, the ssh server is not going
to work.

2. Copy ./sshd_config.default to /usr/local/etc/sshd_config. The ssh
server looks for the config file at the location by default.

3. Open sshd_mon.h file and modify each of the SSH configurations
properly. Please refer to the user account you created at step 0, and
get the uid of the user by `id -u $username`.

4. Compile the downloaded source files by executing ./configure and
make. Do not `make install` since it may overwrite pre-installed ssh
binaries.

5. Make it sure that Inetd is working properly on the testing machine.
This priv-sepped ssh runs only with inetd for now.

6. Add the following line to /etc/inetd.conf

ssh     stream  tcp     nowait  root    $DIR/sshd_mon       sshd_mon

You have to substitute $DIR with the directory where the compiled
sshd_mon file is located.

7. Restart the inet daemon & enjoy!
